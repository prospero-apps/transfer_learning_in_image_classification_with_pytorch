# Transfer Learning in Image Classification with PyTorch
In this project, weâ€™ll use transfer learning to train a model to classify images.

This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to classify satellite images from the EuroSAT dataset.

## Dataset

The [EuroSAT dataset](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.EuroSAT.html#torchvision.datasets.EuroSAT) contains Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 10 different land cover classes:

- AnnualCrop
- Forest
- HerbaceousVegetation
- Highway
- Industrial
- Pasture
- PermanentCrop
- Residential
- River
- SeaLake

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model (trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) and adapting it to a new, but related, task. In this project, we use a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and fine-tune its classifier to classify EuroSAT images.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Download the EuroSAT dataset.
   - Apply necessary transformations (resizing, normalization) to match the pre-trained model's input requirements.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Organize the data into a standard image classification format (subfolders for each class).

2. **Adjusting the Pretrained Model:**
   - Load the pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
   - Freeze all layers except the classifier to preserve pre-trained knowledge.
   - Replace the classifier with a new one that outputs the correct number of classes (10 for EuroSAT).

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Define a loss function (Cross Entropy Loss) and an optimizer (Adam).
   - Create training and testing DataLoaders.
   - Train the model for a specified number of epochs.

4. **Evaluating the Model:**
   - Plot training and testing loss/accuracy curves to assess model performance and identify potential overfitting.

5. **Making Predictions:**
   - Load and preprocess a sample image.
   - Use the trained model to predict the class of the image.
   - Visualize the prediction and associated probability.

## Results

- The model was able to achieve reasonably high accuracy and very high probability in its predictions.
- Overall, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in satellite image classification tasks.
